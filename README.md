# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to provide technical details to Louise who is trying to raise money to put on a play in the United States. The results contain an analysis of previous data related to raising money in various industries/categories. In the analysis, the data is sorted, filtered and more fields and visualizations were created.

## Analysis and Challenges

The given data included the outcomes, dates, country, currency, goal amount raised, pledged amount raised, category and subcategory for 4,114 campaigns. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

One part of the analysis is the Outcomes Based on Launch Date. Using excel, I created a pivot table with the "theater" category only based on the launch date. The table can be filtered by year, and the table itself shows the number of successful, live, failed and canceled outcomes by month. I then created a line graph demonstrated the information in this pivot table.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Another part of the analyis is the Outcomes Based on Goals. Similar to the Outcomes Based on Launch Date analysis, I used excel to create a table with "=countifs" formulas to find the number of successful, failed and canceled campaigns only for the "plays" subcategory based on the goal amount. I then calculated the total number of projets for each goal and calculated the percentages of successful, failed and canceled campaigns. I used this data to create a line graph demonstrating the outcomes based on the goal amount.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I did not come across any challenges while completing this analysis, but it could have become a problem if the data were labeled incorrectly. If data is labeled incorrectly, it makes it more difficult for the people analyzing the data to understand it and create visualizations to display the data. Additionally, it could have been a challenge if I did not understand excel. The person analyzing the data should be able to understand how to use the program to get the most out of it so that the results being displayed to the client are of exceptional quality.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Based on the Outcomes based on Launch Date analysis, it appears that the most successful plays were launched in May. It also seems that the worst time to launch a play is in December. This can be found on the line graph demonstrating that the most number of sucessful plays launched in May and the least number of sucessful plays launched in December. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Based pmn the Outcomes based on Goals analysis, the vast majority of sucessful goals were less than $5,000. Additionally, the most sucessful campaigns had a goal less than $1,000 percentage-wise. Based on the results of the analysis, the lower the goal, the better the campaigns were.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

One limitation of this dataset is that there is no description for Louise's play. If the data contained more detail about it, I could more accurately provide a plan for Louise. I could find specific words that relate to Louise's play to compare and find the best solution. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

 Another possible data or graph we could create would be Outcomes vs. Countries to determine if any countries are outliers. This would mean that one or more data points would be significantly higher or lower than the average. This graph would show the number of successful, failed and canceled campagins by the country. Also, we could create a graph to see the amount pledged vs. the goals to determine how many campaigns with lower goals surpassed their goal. This could help to determine what the goal amount of Louise's campaign should be.
